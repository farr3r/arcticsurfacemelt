# arcticsurfacemelt
Code used to estimate temporal and spatial variation in surface melt of sea ice across the Arctic for my master's thesis.

- Start at the jupyter notebooks (e.g. decadal_trends.ipynb), they are used for analysis/plots etc.
- The notebooks have comments that explain the source of the data which were done using the scripts (e.g. net_monthly_averages.py) on the CPOM server

A breakdown of the different sections of the thesis:

- Decadal trends in surface radiative flluxes
  - have a look at the decadal_trends.ipynb notebook, which plots linear decade trends of albedo and longwave cloud forcing
  - uses data generated by the net_monthly_averages.py and cloud_forcing.py scripts
- Spatial variation in surface melt
  - this is all centred around the surface melt estimations from app-x, which calculates energy absorbed the the ice surface during the melt season. this is done using the ice_abs_mo.py script, which was run on the cpom server
    - this requires several data-sets: app-x 0400 and 1400 passes, sea ice concentration data (which is generated from NSIDC and converted to a format used by this script in sic_tonetcdf.ipynd notebook), NSIDC melt/freeze onset (also converted to be used by this scrip in melt_onset_tonetcdf.ipynb notebook)
  - have a look at the appx_vs_cs2smos.ipynb notebook for the plots comparing the melt derived from the two data-set with sea ice retreat and ice motion overlain
