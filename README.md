# arcticsurfacemelt
Code used to estimate temporal and spatial variation in surface melt of sea ice across the Arctic for my master's thesis.

- Start at the jupyter notebooks (e.g. decadal_trends.ipynb), they are used for analysis/plots etc.
- The notebooks have comments that explain the source of the data which were done using the scripts (e.g. net_monthly_averages.py) on the CPOM server
